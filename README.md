Hey, im Jow, i'm just starting to learn some progamming and decided to post my first "work" (if i can call it like that) in here for fun. 
If you're learning about it aswell, fell free to edit the "game" as you want.
Maybe we can learn together.

Feel free to test it.

Ps: Oh, yeah, the game is in Portuguese. But i coded it in english.
